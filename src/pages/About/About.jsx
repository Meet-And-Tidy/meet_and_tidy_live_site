      <h2>Littering is not just a nuisance but a serious threat to our ecosystem, economy, and human health.</h2>
      <h4>Despite the fact that dropping litter is illegal in Britain, it remains a prevalent issue. While dismissing littering as merely anti-social or lazy behaviour is tempting, many underestimate its profound negative impact.</h4>
      
      <p>A group of people at Yozu have collaborated – in their own time – to develop the concept of an app that can help tackle this growing problem – Meet & Tidy.
        The app aims to shift perceptions and inspire action, urging people to rethink their approach to littering for the betterment of our planet.
      </p>

      <h3>What is Meet & Tidy?</h3>
      <p>The Keep Britain Tidy campaign reports that over two million pieces of litter are dropped every day in the UK, and street cleaning costs taxpayers more than £1 billion a year.
        A wider environmental impact is that over 70,000 pets and wild animals suffer injuries each year due to litter. As global climate change intensifies, the imperative to confront this issue grows clearer by the day.
        Litter picking isn’t just beneficial for the environment — it’s a holistic activity that promotes physical and mental well-being. By reducing the presence of microplastics in water sources and curbing disease spread by vermin, it’s a vital form of exercise with far-reaching benefits.
      </p>

      <p>Meet & Tidy is a passion project that has become an app – a solution that empowers users to discover and organise litter-picking events effortlessly.</p>
      <p>Whether it’s a casual cleanup with friends in the local park, or a more structured gathering at the beach, Meet & Tidy serves as a hub for connecting people, 
        coordinating effort and rallying communities together for a cleaner environment.
      </p>
      <p>Meet &Amp; Tidy: An Eco-Friendly App Helping To Save Our Planet, One Litter Pick At A Time What does Meet & Tidy hope to achieve?</p>
      <p>The mission is threefold:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To enhance the environment</li>
        <li>To strengthen community bonds</li>
        <li>To promote personal well-being
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>By facilitating local cleanups, Meet & Tidy can contribute to a cleaner, healthier planet, by mitigating the adverse effects on ecosystems and wildlife,
        such as hedgehogs and wild birds, while combating global warming.
        An added benefit of cleaner surroundings is that these areas can attract more visitors and bolster local economies.
      </p>

      <h4>Meet & Tidy represents more than just an app—it’s a catalyst for positive change. Together, we can take a stand against littering and create a cleaner, 
        healthier future for generations to come.
      </h4>

      <h3>What was the inspiration behind Meet & Tidy?</h3>
      <p>The idea came from a realisation during the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic, when Yozu software engineer Beth Hubbard made some worrying observations: 
        “Whilst taking daily walks to cope with the isolation, I couldn’t help but notice the staggering amount of litter tarnishing my town and its surroundings” she says.
        Beth continues “Witnessing the detrimental effects on both the area and its wildlife prompted me to take action. I began volunteering for beach cleanups and experienced firsthand the sense of fulfillment that comes from making a positive impact.
        “It was this experience that fueled my desire to create a platform like Meet & Tidy—a tool to empower others to join the cause.”
