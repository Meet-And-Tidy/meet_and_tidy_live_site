# Meet and Tidy Live Site

**Once you've followed the steps in the meet_and_tidy_website repo:**

- push the copied over files to main (these should essentially be basic html/css/js files)
- once pushed, got into settings -> pages
- click on page link https://meet-and-tidy.github.io/meet_and_tidy_live_site/
- the live site should update, if its not changed, give it 5 minutes to catch up
